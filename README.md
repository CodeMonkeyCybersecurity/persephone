# Persephone: Enhanced Restic Backup Wrapper

In Greek mythology, **Persephone** is the goddess of both the underworld and springtime. This represents cycles of loss and renewal—paralleling the backup and recovery process. 

**Persephone** is a solution designed to simplify and enhance the use of Restic for backups and recovery, providing additional features like centralized management, automated scheduling, and modular configuration.

This will currently work only on debian-based systems (eg. Ubuntu, Debian, Kali). **Work is ongoing to expand this to MacOS and Windows.**
